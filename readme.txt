Welcome to the legendary modified game of breakout...
The instructions to the game is as easy as you think it is....
JUST BREAK AS MANY BRICKS AS YOU CAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your paddle moves in the direction of your mouse, so it makes the game very seamless
and interactive. Although the game sounds familiar, there are some power up Icons you
need to know before you begin. They are listed below:

Power Ups:
- PAD++ : increases the length of your pad
- SPEED++ : increases the speed of your ball(s)
- MISSILE : Gives you five bullets for every power up.(Click on the brick to fire missile)
- OOO : Produces more than one ball to make the total number of balls 10 in the game
- LIVE++ : Adds an extra live for every LIVE++ power up.

ALL POWER UPS ARE LOST IF YOU DIE IN A GAME SESSION

As you proceed to other levels:
- Some bricks are coloured black. These bricks must me hit as many times as the level you 
  are currently in. These bricks must be destroyed to proceed to next level.
- some bricks are coloured white. These bricks can only be destroyed with missile power
  ups, but they must not be destroyed to go to the next level. Did I forget to mention that
  These bricks also move!!!!!

THATS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW TO BE A CHAMPION.
NOW YOU KNOW THE THEORY. CAN YOU BEAT THE GAME!!!!!!!!!!.
